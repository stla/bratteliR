This package deals with [Bratteli
graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bratteli_diagram). In every
function of the package, the Bratteli graph is given by a function
returning for a level `n` of the graph the incidence matrix of the graph
between level `n` and level `n+1`: the `(i,j)`-entry of this matrix is
the number of edges between the `i`-th vertex at level `n` and the
`j`-th vertex at level `n+1`.

For example, the binary tree is defined by:

``` r
tree <- function(n) {
  M <- matrix(0, nrow = 2^n, ncol = 2^(n+1))
  for(i in 1:nrow(M)) {
    M[i, ][c( 2*(i-1)+1, 2*(i-1)+2 )] <- 1
  }
  M
}
```

The function `bratteliGraph` generates some LaTeX code which renders the
graph up to a given level:

``` r
bratteliGraph("binaryTree.tex", tree, 3)
```

If you donâ€™t like the style, you are free to modify the LaTeX code.

Here is a binary tree with double edges:

``` r
tree2 <- function(n) {
  M <- matrix(0, nrow = 2^n, ncol = 2^(n+1))
  for(i in 1:nrow(M)) {
    M[i, ][c( 2*(i-1)+1, 2*(i-1)+2 )] <- 2
  }
  M
}
bratteliGraph("binaryTree2.tex", tree2, 3)
```

Here is the code for the Pascal graph:

``` r
Pascal <- function(n) {
  M <- matrix(0, nrow = n+1, ncol = n+2)
  for(i in 1:(n+1)) {
    M[i, ][c( i, i+1L )] <- 1
  }
  M
}
```

The *dimension* of a vertex of a Bratteli graph is the number of paths
of the graph going from the root vertex to this vertex. The function
`bratteliDimensions` of the package computes these numbers:

``` r
library(bratteli)
bratteliDimensions(Pascal, 3)
```

    ## [[1]]
    ## [1] "1" "1"
    ## 
    ## [[2]]
    ## [1] "1" "2" "1"
    ## 
    ## [[3]]
    ## [1] "1" "3" "3" "1"

Bratteli graphs are of interest to ergodicians, and particularly to
Vershik, who introduced the *intrinsic kernels* of a Bratteli graph and
the *intrinsic distance* between the vertices of a Bratteli graph. Here
is a picture of the Pascal graph showing the intrinsic kernels:

``` r
bratteliGraph("Pascal.tex", Pascal, 3, edgelabels = "kernels")
```

The intrinsic kernels are returned by the function `bratteliKernels`.
The intrinsic distances between two vertices at the same level are
returned by the function `bratteliDistances`.
