This package deals with 
[Bratteli graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bratteli_diagram). 
In every function of the package, the Bratteli graph is given by a function 
returning for a level `n` of the graph the incidence matrix of the graph 
between level `n` and level `n+1`: the `(i,j)`-entry of this matrix is the 
number of edges between the `i`-th vertex at level `n` and the `j`-th vertex at
level `n+1`.

For example, the binary tree is defined by:
```{r tree, eval=FALSE}
tree <- function(n) {
  M <- matrix(0, nrow = 2^n, ncol = 2^(n+1))
  for(i in 1:nrow(M)) {
    M[i, ][c( 2*(i-1)+1, 2*(i-1)+2 )] <- 1
  }
  M
}
```

The function `bratteliGraph` generates some LaTeX code which renders the graph 
up to a given level:

```{r treeGraph, eval=FALSE}
bratteliGraph("binaryTree.tex", tree, 3)
```

If you don't like the style, you are free to modify the LaTeX code.

Here is a binary tree with double edges:
```{r tree2, eval=FALSE}
tree2 <- function(n) {
  M <- matrix(0, nrow = 2^n, ncol = 2^(n+1))
  for(i in 1:nrow(M)) {
    M[i, ][c( 2*(i-1)+1, 2*(i-1)+2 )] <- 2
  }
  M
}
bratteliGraph("binaryTree2.tex", tree2, 3)
```

Here is the code for the Pascal graph:
```{r Pascal}
Pascal <- function(n) {
  M <- matrix(0, nrow = n+1, ncol = n+2)
  for(i in 1:(n+1)) {
    M[i, ][c( i, i+1L )] <- 1
  }
  M
}
```

The *dimension* of a vertex of a Bratteli graph is the number of paths of the 
graph going from the root vertex to this vertex. The function 
`bratteliDimensions` of the package computes these numbers:

```{r Pascal-dimensions}
library(bratteli)
bratteliDimensions(Pascal, 3)
```

Bratteli graphs are of interest to ergodicians, and particularly to Vershik, 
who introduced the *intrinsic kernels* of a Bratteli graph and the 
*intrinsic distance* between the vertices of a Bratteli graph. Here is a picture of the Pascal graph showing the intrinsic kernels:

```{r PascalGraph, eval=FALSE}
bratteliGraph("Pascal.tex", Pascal, 3, edgelabels = "kernels")
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stla/bratteliR/main/inst/graphs/Pascal-kernels.png)

The intrinsic kernels are returned by the function `bratteliKernels`. The 
intrinsic distances between two vertices at the same level are returned by 
the function `bratteliDistances`.
